<h2>How it Works</h2>

</BR>

The script  takes pictures from a Laptop's Webcam in stealth mode, without opening terminals or images.</BR>
It does not open any terminals and acts completely stealthily (both .pyw and exe files), making it ideal </BR>
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_surfing_(computer_security)">Shoulder Surfing</a> sessions.
The program saves the pictures captured by the webcam in the user profile folder. </BR>
To avoid overwriting existing images, each new image is saved with an incremental name. </BR>
The path and name of the images can be easily set in the code.</BR>
I purposely avoided the use of code checks, to avoid the output of error prompts, </BR>
this is to avoid creating suspicion in case the program, for some reason, fails.

<h2>How, and Why, To Use It in a Real Scenario</h2>

</BR>

Nowadays everyone has a smartphone in their pocket, and thus the ability to </BR>
take pictures in very few seconds, so why the need to create a laptop script?</BR>
Well first of all because anyway, in some cases, the gesture of taking a picture via smartphone can create suspicion, </BR>
and then there are some cases where doing things from laptop from a certain concealability.</BR>
Imagine a high-security place, such as an airport, or at a classic coffee shop </BR>
with free wifi conection, where people often bring their laptops with them.</BR>
Wouldn't it be nice to have the ability to do this from a computer, and without arousing any suspicion?
